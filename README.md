WDD420: Lesson Learned from this Course Project 

I have gained a lot from WDD420 more than I have learned from other courses. I have learned a lot about accessibility and how important it is in todays world to make sure our products are accessible to everyone. There are different types of challenges that people face. Web accessibility covers all disabilities that has an affect on the Web world. Those Disabilities include; auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. Web Accessibility does not only benefit those with permanent disabilities but also those with temporary disabilities such as a broken arm or lost glasses, etc. 

Being introduced to Web accessibility has made a deep impact on me. It has really expanded my view on web design and development. Before I was a designing that cared only about one thing. That was, the look of the website. Now I am a designer who chooses to focus on web accessibility first. 

My amazing professor gave me the opportunity to work on a website that I was working on previously and improve the website’s accessibility. This was really fun because I got to work with a website that I was passionate about. 

Thorough out the course, we learned about different way to actually deal with web accessibility. How to use form validations, color contrast and so much more. Because of this course, I was able to improve my javascript knowledge exponentially. 

Form validation was one of the things that I enjoyed the most because how good my validation were going to determine how good the accessibility of the website was going to be. 

If I were to fix something and do better would off course be my validations. Because I used Javascript as the main source of validations, I skipped over PHP’s validation. Knowing now that users have the ability to turn off Javascript, which can totally make my validation worthless, I will definitely be using PHP’s validations as well.
